<p>First off, my design was definitely influenced by two friends,
TheQleaner (TQ) &amp; Genom. TQ built his cabinet first and
convinced me to build mine. It was something I'd wanted to do
ever since I first saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521173943/http://www.arcadeathome.com/"> Tim's page</a> go up, but I just didn't think
I could pull off the woodworking. I'm perfectly at home with a
soldering iron, but had never touched a jig saw. TQ talked me
into it. Genom actually helped me cut the wood, let me use his
tools &amp; his workspace (we converted his living room into a woodshop), and helped me haul it all back to my
place. He was a huge help &amp; should be starting on his cabinet
soon.</p>

<p>I went through about 6 design revisions on the cabinet before
I bought the wood. The primary consideration is the monitor. The
monitor dimensions determine how wide the cabinet will be. The
control panel dimensions &amp; monitor depth determined how deep
the cabinet needed to be, and everything else worked backwards
from there.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to use a TV for my monitor, so I measured 25&quot; TVs at Best Buy &amp; every other home electronics store I could
find. I decided to settle on a width of 26&quot;, because it will
easily accommodate just about any 25&quot; TV. I also noticed that
there were several 27&quot; units that would fit, so that may be
an option as well. Making it a little wider would have ensured a
27&quot; TV would fit, but I still wanted to be able to fit it
through a door. I measured the depth as well and found they were
all about 21&quot; deep or less, so I wanted to have at least
that much room for it to sit back into the cabinet. </p>

<p>Next I went to an arcade, and measured the height of the
control panels at around 36&quot;, and the cabinets averaged
about 6' 2&quot; tall. I also checked out the marquees, and they
were about 7&quot; - 8&quot; tall.</p>

<p>Then I did a full size mock up of the control panel top, so I
could figure out how big it needed to be. I ended up with 16&quot;
X 32&quot;, but later added a bit all around to give it a little
better overhang. In the end, the CP ended up being 18&quot; X 34&quot;.
I also decided to use a CP box, rather then integrating it into
the cabinet. This way I can have more space for the electronics,
and I can remove the CP as a unit to get the cabinet through a
doorway.</p>

<p>I took all these measurements and started plotting out cabinet
profiles in scale on graph paper. I decided to make the entire
front of the cabinet (where the coin door goes) a big door to
access the interior. I also decided to use a wireless keyboard so
I wouldn't have to have a keyboard drawer. I also left the back
partially open hoping to avoid the need for a loud ventilation fan. For the drawings, I used custom graph paper printed with a
great little utility I found online. I used it to make graph
paper representing 4' X 8' sheets so I could get an idea of how
much of the cutting I could have done at home depot, and how many
sheets of wood I would need. When I was satisfied with the shape
of the cabinet, I built a miniature scale model out of cardboard.</p>

<p>Up until the very last
revision the cabinet had a high back similar to a defender cab.
Genom helped convince me to go with the angled back, and I'm glad
I did. I like the way it looks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may notice on the design sheets I made 2 control panels.&nbsp; I know
that eventually I'll want a dedicated panel of some kind and will want to be
able to swap the panels.&nbsp; I don't know what the next control panel will be,
but I have the extra CP top sitting here just in case.&nbsp; Also, I forgot to
cut the front and back base plates, so I left them off the actual cabinet.</p>
