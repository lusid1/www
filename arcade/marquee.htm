<p align="left">I originally planned to make a handpainted blacklight marquee
for the cabinet, but a<font size="3">s it turned out, the blacklight marquee
looked awful.&nbsp; Mostly due to my
complete lack of skill in sign painting.&nbsp; Also, if I decide to try it again
later I'll be using 2 blacklights in there for more brightness.&nbsp; One&nbsp; just
wasn't bright enough.&nbsp; Instead I took the high res M.A.M.E. logo into
Photopaint, cropped it and printed it across 3 sheets @ 720dpi.&nbsp; Much
better.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">It's sandwiched between 2 sheets of&nbsp;</font><font size="3">
Plexiglas.&nbsp; It's held in place by a Happ marquee retainer, and lit from
behind with an 18&quot; flourescent light fixture. The Plexi came with a
protective white coating on both sides.&nbsp; I left the coating on one side of
the back plate to help diffuse the white fluorescent light. </font></p>
