<p align="left">The cabinet is covered with black &quot;chalkboard&quot; contact
paper.&nbsp; It's not the most durable finish, but it looks really good and
wasn't very expensive.&nbsp; It took about 8 rolls to cover the cabinet, and
another roll of green for the control panel.&nbsp; Total cost of about
$30.&nbsp; The finished surface actually can be used as a chalkboard.&nbsp; I
coated a piece of scrap to test with some colored chalk, and it is a chalkboard,
but I couldn't bring myself to start drawing on the cabinet.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">I found mine at Target, but not all Targets carry this style.
Here are the details in case you want to hunt some down to play with:</p>

<p align="left">And then there is the T molding.&nbsp; I borrowed a router with
a slot cutting bit, and ran it along the edge of the cabinet.&nbsp; It cuts a
slot about 1/2&quot; deep on the edge of the wood.&nbsp; The T molding just
presses into that slot.&nbsp; If it doesn't stay put, a little white glue will
do the trick.&nbsp; Since I mounted my top &amp; back panels flush with the edge
of the side panels I could only apply the t molding to the front, otherwise I
would risk hitting a screw with the router &amp; that could be dangerous.&nbsp;
On Genom's cabinet we routed the panels while they were still on the workbench
right after we cut them out.&nbsp; Then we recessed the top &amp; back panels
1/2&quot; and it worked out much better.</p>
