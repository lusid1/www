<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">Finishing</font></p>
<p align="left">The cabinet is covered with black &quot;chalkboard&quot; contact
paper.&nbsp; It's not the most durable finish, but it looks really good and
wasn't very expensive.&nbsp; It took about 8 rolls to cover the cabinet, and
another roll of green for the control panel.&nbsp; Total cost of about
$30.&nbsp; The finished surface actually can be used as a chalkboard.&nbsp; I
coated a piece of scrap to test with some colored chalk, and it is a chalkboard,
but I couldn't bring myself to start drawing on the cabinet.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">I found mine at Target, but not all Targets carry this style.
Here are the details in case you want to hunt some down to play with:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="27%"><img border="0" src="/web/20160518070014im_/http://www.lusid.net/arcade/contactpaper50t.jpg" width="123" height="73"></td>
    <td width="73%">Con-Tact Brand<br>
      Style 9052 &quot;Chalkboard&quot;<br>
      1-877-353-6420<br>
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518070014/http://www.con-tact.com/">www.con-tact.com</a><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left">And then there is the T molding.&nbsp; I borrowed a router with
a slot cutting bit, and ran it along the edge of the cabinet.&nbsp; It cuts a
slot about 1/2&quot; deep on the edge of the wood.&nbsp; The T molding just
presses into that slot.&nbsp; If it doesn't stay put, a little white glue will
do the trick.&nbsp; Since I mounted my top &amp; back panels flush with the edge
of the side panels I could only apply the t molding to the front, otherwise I
would risk hitting a screw with the router &amp; that could be dangerous.&nbsp;
On Genom's cabinet we routed the panels while they were still on the workbench
right after we cut them out.&nbsp; Then we recessed the top &amp; back panels
1/2&quot; and it worked out much better.</p>
