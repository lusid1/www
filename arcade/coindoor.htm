<p align="center">This is a Happ Over/Under coin door with dual 25¢ coin mechs.&nbsp;
$75 well spent.&nbsp; I know this is never going into a coin op environment, but
it really makes it feel authentic when you drop a quarter in &amp; hear the game
respond.&nbsp; Besides, it makes a great piggy bank.</p>
<p align="center">It's mounted to the front door of the cabinet.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Here is the view with the door open:<img border="0" src="coindooropen25.jpg" width="297" height="252"></p>
<p align="left">I ran power from the PC's 12V power supply to drive the plunger
lamps, and wired the switch contacts into the LP24.&nbsp; You can see in the
picture one of the flush mount hinges I used to mount the door as well as the
keylock.&nbsp; What you can't see are the small L-brackets I used as a doorstop.</p>
