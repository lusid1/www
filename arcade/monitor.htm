<p align="center">The monitor is an RCA 25&quot; TV. here is a link to the product's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518072029/http://www.rca.com/product/viewdetail/0,1186,PI80-CI104,00.html">web
page</a>.</p>
<p align="left"> I'm using the S-video
port. I'm very pleased with the image quality, but it has one
'feature' that might annoy you if you graft one into your cabinet.&nbsp; It has
an on screen menu that you must go through every time it gets unplugged.&nbsp;
You can skip the programming sequence, but it will always pop up.&nbsp; No big
deal for my design (how often am I going to unplug it? never.), but something to
be aware of and perhaps avoid if you use a TV for your cabinet.&nbsp; Actually,
I have 2 power lines running to the cabinet.&nbsp; One for the monitor that is
not switched, and one for everything else switched at a power strip nearby.</p>
<p align="left">For a bezel, I cut one to fit from 1/4&quot; foam core from an
office supply store and covered it with the same black contact paper used on the
rest of the cabinet.&nbsp; Not the best solution, but it achieves the desired
effect.&nbsp; Note the IR detector for the keyboard on the right, and the access
to the controls on the front.</p>
<p align="left">Here is a picure with the bezel removed:<br>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">A few people have written me asking why I chose to use a TV
instead of an arcade or PC monitor.&nbsp; It's mostly a question of Size vs.
Cost.&nbsp; The vertical games wouldn't look right on a 19&quot; computer (or
arcade) monitor unless the monitor was able to rotate.&nbsp; I know several
people have made rotating monitors, but I wasn't up for it.&nbsp; Also, I knew I
would want to play some PC games and console emulators on the cabinet.&nbsp;
That pretty much eliminates using an arcade monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; TheQleaner used
a TV in his cabinet &amp; I had already been running MAME on my 32&quot; TV, so
I knew what to expect from that kind of setup.&nbsp; I could get a very good
25&quot; tv for way less then a very bad 19&quot; computer monitor anyway and 25&quot;
computer monitors are forbiddingly expensive.</p>
<p align="left">Several people have asked for pictures of various games running
on the cabinet.&nbsp; Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518072029/http://members.xoom.com/lusid" target="_blank">here
they are.</a>&nbsp; </p>
