<p align="center"><font size="5">The Computer</font></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The computer is a K6-2 400mhz with 96 megs of ram. It runs almost everything
perfectly, but I need to drop in another 32 to get the rest of the games to
load. It was built mostly from spare parts
on hand. I am using the ATI cards S-Video output through an RCA 25&quot; TV. </p>

<p>Here are the current system specs: </p>

<ul>
  <li>K6-2 400mhz</li>
  <li>128 Megs ram</li>
  <li>4gig IDE drives (2)</li>
  <li>ATI Rage Fury 32 meg.</li>
  <li>3com 10bT network card</li>
  <li>Creative Awe64</li>
  <li>Creative 24X CD</li>
  <li>Windows98</li>
</ul>

<p>Originally I had an old ATI All-In-Wonder but it had no 3D support, but after
dropping in the Rage Fury I could run just about anything.</p>

<p>I tried a Voodoo3 3000 AGP, to see how well the TV out feature worked.&nbsp;
The results were not good.&nbsp; As long as I didn't leave windows, the TV out worked fine, but as soon as I
launched DOS mame I ran into trouble immediately.<br>
1st, unless you explicitly specify a resolution it scrunches the screen much
like the newer mame's do if you use 16bit color on an 8 bit game.<br>
2nd, at all resolutions below 800x600 the tv out was black&amp;white.</p>

<p>#1 you can work around, #2 renders it useless..
<p>I emailed 3dfx support to see if they could help with the color problem &amp;
they wrote back saying to forget it. &quot;TV out does not fully support Dos
resolutions&quot; &amp; it &quot;was not designed to function without a
monitor&quot;. I personally suspected that it was a bios compatibility issue
with my motherboard, but they had no interest in helping me. A quick search of
related forums on the web found a lot of people with similar problems and no
solutions. Also, if you look at the specs on the V4 &amp; V5 cards coming next
year, they have dropped TV out altogether. Apparently instead of fixing a broken
arm they would rather cut off the limb.&nbsp;&nbsp;
