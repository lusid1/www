<p align="center"><font size="4">How to interface Happ optical devices via a
hacked mouse</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Happ's spinner &amp; trackball all use the same
optical sensor board.&nbsp; I'll show you how to wire it up to a mouse so you
don't spend $50 on an interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Each Axis uses 1 board, so a spinner only uses
one, but a trackball uses 2.&nbsp; The rotating joysticks probably use the same
board as well, although I don't have one (yet :).</p>
<p align="left">And here it is:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="/web/20160426184808im_/http://www.lusid.net/arcade/happhack.gif" width="286" height="259"></p>
<p align="left">The +5V &amp; Ground are wired to either the host system's power
supply( which is what I did), or you can get a 5 volt adapter from someplace
like Radio Shack.</p>
<p align="left">Left, Center and Right refer to the pins on the mouse
board.&nbsp; I know these are not the technical terms, but if you were into the
tech stuff you wouldn't need to read this page.</p>
<p align="left">Get a cheap mouse and completely disassemble it. I used a
PCConcepts Combo Mouse. Remove the optical wheels, and pull the board out.&nbsp;
You'll need some very basic soldering skills here.&nbsp; Locate the axis you
want to hack to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> You'll find 2 components, one on either side of where the
wheel was.&nbsp; One is the emitter, the other is the detector.&nbsp; They may
have a plastic housing over them which you will need to remove.</p>
<p align="left">The Emitter (an IR LED) is usually clear.&nbsp; There may be a
part number marking near it on the board such as IR1 or D6.&nbsp; Leave&nbsp;
this part alone.&nbsp; we are interested in the detector.</p>
<p align="left">The Detector is usually black, but not always.&nbsp; There may
be a part number near it on the board such as Q3.&nbsp; It should have 3
leads.</p>

      <td> Turn the board over and find where they solder onto the circuit
side.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p> Unsolder this component, all 3 leads, and remove it from the
circuit.&nbsp; The three holes, if held so they form a row, with the emitter
above them, are the left, center and right referred to in the interface hack
diagram.</p>
        <p>(Note the 3 solder points just under the left of the optical wheel
        slot. This happens to be the Y axis)</td>

      <td>This was a PCConcepts Combo mouse.&nbsp; It's running my trackball via
        the PS2 port.&nbsp; I removed the switches for the left &amp; right
        mouse buttons and ran wires to buttons on the control panel.&nbsp; Note
        the 2 pairs of wire in the upper left &amp; right.
        <p>Also, note the clear emitter on the lower right. The detector has
        been removed, and this time I ran the wires from the component side of
        the board.&nbsp; Much cleaner.</p>
