        <p>This is an external player module for Showshifter.  It lets you open a video file from Showshifter's video read folders, and play it in the application of your choice.  It also auto mute's the live-tv, and has mute enforcement to keep showshifter from un-muting it.</p>

<p>It's intended use it to watch an existing recording in another media player while showshifter is busy recording something else.  Although it should work with any media player, it works really well with Zoom Player.  Zoom Player can be downloaded from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040813081014/http://www.inmatrix.com/">www.inmatrix.com</a>.</p>

        <p>This file contains my zoom player settings, and my zoom player key mappings.  Several of the keys used in media playback are set to use showshifter's keyboard mappings, and the settings allow for near seemless integration.  They can get you up and running fast.</p>

        <p>This module builds upon the hello world module, adding some common controls to the interface.  It uses the Edit, CheckBox, Button, and DropList controls as well as the MessageBox and the FilePicker.  It can popup a messagebox and launch external programs.  Still nothing useful, but the source is included.</p>
