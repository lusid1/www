			<p>This is an external player module for Showshifter. It lets you 
			open a video file from Showshifter's video read folders, and play it 
			in the application of your choice. It also auto mute's the live-tv, 
			and has mute enforcement to keep showshifter from un-muting it.</p>
			<p>It's intended use it to watch an existing recording in another 
			media player while showshifter is busy recording something else. 
			Although it should work with any media player, it works really well 
			with Zoom Player. Zoom Player can be downloaded from
			<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230131031108/http://www.inmatrix.com/">www.inmatrix.com</a>.</p>

			<p>This file contains my zoom player settings, and my zoom player 
			key mappings. Several of the keys used in media playback are set to 
			use showshifter's keyboard mappings, and the settings allow for near 
			seemless integration. They can get you up and running fast.</p>
